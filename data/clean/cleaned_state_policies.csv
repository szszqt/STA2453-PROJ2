New Mexicans must remain home except for outings essential for health, safety and welfare, especially elderly and vulnerable individuals. If you must leave home, gatherings of more than five people remain prohibited and 6 feet of physical distance from others must be maintained.
Large retailers like big-box stores and grocery stores will continue operating at 20 percent capacity as determined by fire code.  
Other high-intensity contact services that must remain closed include indoor malls, massage and tattoo parlors, theaters, casinos.
WHAT WILL CHANGE BEGINNING MAY 16:
All retailers may operate according to COVID-Safe Practices (“CSPs”) at 25 percent fire code occupancy (a “retailer” is any business that sells goods directly to the ultimate consumer or end-users and does not include wholesalers or suppliers, not does it include entertainment venues such as movie theaters, concert halls, or amusement parks);
Non-essential businesses (other than retailers; such as office spaces, call centers) generally may operate according to CSPs at up to 25 percent of pre-crisis staffing levels. All employees should continue to work from home wherever possible;

John Bel Edwards' Proclamation 89 JBE 2020 on 7/11: ordered a mandatory mask requirement for Louisiana as well as limited crowd sizes to 50 in both indoor spaces and outdoor spaces where 6 ft social distancing is not possible: all individuals to wear face coverings when inside of commercial establishments or other buildings or spaces open to the public, both indoors and outdoors, including public transportation.  Businesses and organizations must require persons entering to be wearing a face covering unless exceptions apply.  
The statewide mask mandate applies to all 64 parishes in Louisiana. However, parishes with a COVID-19 incidence of fewer than 100 cases per 100,000 people for the most recent two-week period for which data is available could choose to opt out of the mandate. Parish presidents do not have to opt out and may choose to keep a mask mandate in place. Currently, only three parishes in Louisiana do not exceed this standard, which will be updated every other week by the Louisiana Department of Health: Grant, Red River and West Feliciana.
The order requires face coverings for everyone ages 8 and older except for the following:
Anyone who has a medical condition that prevents the wearing of a face covering
Anyone who is consuming a drink or food
Anyone who is trying to communicate with a person who is hearing impaired
Anyone who is giving a speech for broadcast or to an audience
Anyone temporarily removing his or her face covering for identification purposes
Anyone who is a resident of a parish without a high COVID incidence that has opted out of the masking mandate
