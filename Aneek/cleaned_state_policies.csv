This will be a deliberate process, and is flexible to adapt to the situation. Some communities may be able to reopen at a faster rate, while others may need to continue restrictions to keep the virus from spreading. During Phase I, we should limit our activity and interactions and continue to maintain social distancing and practice good hygiene to protect our neighbors and ourselves.

Citizens who feel sick should stay home!
Continue to practice good hygiene, including:
Washing hands with soap and water, or using hand sanitizer, especially after touching frequently used items or surfaces;
Avoiding touching your face;
Sneezing or coughing into a tissue, or the inside of your elbow; and
Disinfecting frequently used items and surfaces as much as possible.
Avoid socializing in groups that do not readily allow for appropriate physical distancing (receptions, trade shows, etc.). When in public (parks, outdoor recreation spaces, shopping malls, etc.), individuals should maximize physical distance from others.

New Mexicans must remain home except for outings essential for health, safety and welfare, especially elderly and vulnerable individuals. If you must leave home, gatherings of more than five people remain prohibited and 6 feet of physical distance from others must be maintained. Large retailers like big-box stores and grocery stores will continue operating at 20 percent capacity as determined by fire code. Locations and services where high-intensity contact is unavoidable – such as gyms, salons and dine-in service at restaurants and bars – will remain temporarily closed. Limited in-person operations for those types of businesses could be included in the next modification of the public health order, as soon as early June, depending on New Mexico’s rate of COVID-19 transmission, testing capacity and other gating criteria. Other high-intensity contact services that must remain closed include indoor malls, massage and tattoo parlors, theaters, casinos. 14-day quarantine order remains in place for out-of-state airport arrivals. Vacation rentals prohibited to out-of-state residents. Visits to long-term care and other congregate care facilities remain restricted. WHAT WILL CHANGE BEGINNING MAY 16: All retailers may operate according to COVID-Safe Practices (“CSPs”) at 25 percent fire code occupancy (a “retailer” is any business that sells goods directly to the ultimate consumer or end-users and does not include wholesalers or suppliers, not does it include entertainment venues such as movie theaters, concert halls, or amusement parks); Non-essential businesses (other than retailers; such as office spaces, call centers) generally may operate according to CSPs at up to 25 percent of pre-crisis staffing levels. All employees should continue to work from home wherever possible; Houses of worship may operate at 10 percent occupancy; Additional state parks and certain outdoor recreation guides with COVID-Safe Practices; Masks will be required of everyone in public places, with exceptions for eating, drinking and exercising and medical requirements.
